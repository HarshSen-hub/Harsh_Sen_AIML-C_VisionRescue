## 📝 Project Description
**Vision Rescue** is an AI-powered system designed to assist in identifying and locating missing persons through facial recognition technology. The system combines a web-based interface, a Node.js backend, and machine learning models written in Python.

The project aims to make a real-world impact by supporting communities, NGOs, and authorities in efficiently finding and reuniting with missing individuals. It enables users to submit reports, search databases, and match faces using AI models trained for real-time recognition.
